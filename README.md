- Hello, my name is Sean Walker (aka @WhateverFits) and I am a travelling Software Engineer. Basically, I love what I do and that is travelling, cooking, and designing/building software. I've worked from many countries in my travels and enjoy what I do. This is my playground here, as I've put my hobby projects visible to the public.
- I'm currently learning Arduino controller coding as well as slightly less basic circuitry. Designing PCBs? Not yet. Just basic soldering of point to point connections. I'm getting there. I also started to take a look at Svelte for frontend work since most of my work is backend programming. It seems pretty easy to use and only a little bit quirky.
