- Hello, my name is Sean Walker (aka @WhateverFits) and I am a travelling Software Engineer. Basically, I love what I do and that is travelling, cooking, and designing/building software. I've worked from many countries in my travels and enjoy what I do. This is my playground here, as I've put my hobby projects visible to the public.
- I'm currently learning Arduino controller coding as well as slightly less basic circuitry. Designing PCBs? Not yet. Just basic soldering of point to point connections. I'm getting there. I also started to take a look at Svelte for frontend work since most of my work is backend programming. It seems pretty easy to use and only a little bit quirky.
- My day job is a Software Architect and Engineer for Fiserv dealing with large systems so my play time deals with small systems like home automation and microcontrollers. Of course I've also built my fair share of industrial scale systems (even at home) so it feels good to get closer to the bare metal to anchor myself and remember that CPU cycles still matter.
